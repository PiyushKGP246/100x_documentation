# Product Variation

The product variation entity represents a SKU that is for sale. It has a price, shipping price and possibly a size or color. Each product variation belongs to one product and each product has at least one product variation. A user always buys a product variation, and each SKU in your system will map to one product variation in Hopscotch.

With this API you can create and update product variations. You can also retrieve details about specific product variations or page through all your product variations.
